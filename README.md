# AI_Chess
AI Chess is a chess engine built from scratch, leveraging the advanced capabilities of GPT-4, the latest iteration of OpenAI's language model. This project aims to demonstrate the process of developing a chess engine step by step, starting from the ground up.

# Features:
**GPT-4 Powered**: The core logic and decision-making of the chess engine are driven by GPT-4, enabling sophisticated gameplay and strategic thinking.<br>
**Built from Scratch**: Every aspect of the chess engine, from board representation to move generation and evaluation functions, is meticulously crafted from scratch.<br>
**AI Capabilities**: The engine incorporates AI capabilities developed from the ground up, allowing it to learn and improve through gameplay.<br>
**Open Source**: GPT4 Chess is open-source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.<br>

# How it works:
GPT4 Chess utilizes GPT-4's natural language processing capabilities to interpret board states, generate possible moves, and evaluate positions. Through a combination of deep learning techniques and traditional chess algorithms, the engine is able to play high-quality games of chess against human opponents or other engines.

# Contributions:
Contributions to GPT4 Chess are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving the engine's performance, adding new features, or optimizing existing code, your contributions are valued and appreciated.

# Getting Started:
To get started with GPT4 Chess, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README. You can start playing against the engine or use it as a platform for further experimentation and development.
